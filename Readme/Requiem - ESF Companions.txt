Info:

The patch requires the full version of ESF Companions.
The requirements-only version is fully compatible with Requiem and doesn't require a patch.



Load Order:

Must be loaded after "Requiem_Minor_Arcana.esp".

Must be loaded after "Requiem - Immersive Weapons.esp". This doesn't fully resolve conflicts, but is better than the opposite order.
