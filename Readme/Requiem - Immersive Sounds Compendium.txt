Info:
This is an all-in-one patch for WAFR, CCF, CCOR, KFR, COR, Immersive Sounds Compendium and Requiem.
If you don't use all of them, install the modular patches from Immersive Sounds Compendium.
This makes the Requiem, WAFR, CCF and CCOR patch from the Immersive Sounds Compendium installer redundant. Do NOT install any of these patches.

Should be loaded as one of the first Requiem patches/addons.
