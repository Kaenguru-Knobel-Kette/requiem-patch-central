Info:

This patch is meant to be used alongside Craftable Horse Barding.

Do NOT install the Hearthfire patch from Immersive Horses. It's fully included in this patch.

The "open inventory" option from Immersive Horses acts just like the "search" option from Requiem (when used on a horse). Use whatever method you prefer.

Saddles, that hide a horse's mane AND are already equipped when you claim the horse, will disappear forever when you close the menu. This is a bug in Immersive Horses and not caused by the patch.
This bug doesn't occur if you use the Craftable Horse Barding patch because horses only wear basic saddles when you claim them.
