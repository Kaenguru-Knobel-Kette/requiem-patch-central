Info:

The patch requires the normal version that is listed under the miscellaneous files. The HighSpawn version isn't supported.

The patch replaces the original plugin because it contains several errors and is rather small.
You have to disable or delete "83Willows_101BUGS_V4_HighRes.esp" and "83Willows_101BUGS_V4_LowRes.esp".
