Info:

Requires the main file from Improved Closefaced Helmets and the Silver Knight Armor patch.

The patch replaces the original plugin because it contains a few errors and ITMs and is rather small.
You have to disable or delete "imp_helm_legend.esp" and "ICH - Silver Knight Patch.esp".



Load Order:

Must be loaded after "Requiem_Minor_Arcana.esp".

In general should be loaded as one of the last Requiem patches/addons.
