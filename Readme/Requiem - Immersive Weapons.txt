Info:

Do NOT install the Immersive Weapons USLEEP Patch. It's fully included in this patch.



Load Order:



Must be loaded before "Requiem_Minor_Arcana.esp". This doesn't fully resolve conflicts, but is better than the opposite order.



Weapon Types:

Spears and crescents are new weapon types without proper integration to Skyrim.
For the sake of simplicity they share their stats with the (great)sword of the same level. Spears deal piercing damage.
NPCs won't carry them because they lack proper animations.
